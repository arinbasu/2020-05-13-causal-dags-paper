\subsection{Recapping DAGs}\label{recapping-dags}}

We are going to write about DAGs in epidemiology and using them. As we
discussed in the first paper, DAGs or directed acyclic graphs are graphs
that use one way arrows to connect exposure variables (A) with outcome
variables (Y) and in the process help us to make explicit the
connections.
